OVERVIEW

Strava is CHANGING THEIR API VERY SOON (within days - http://engineering.strava.com/update-on-the-api-v3-release-and-v1-v2-retirement/). This is good because privacy will improve. This is bad because it will make downloading your ride data much harder. 

Maybe they'll change this (they should), maybe they won't. Best to get your data now and be safe about it.

This is a PHP script that takes ALL YOUR RIDES from the social fitness site Strava.com and saves them as files. The only user-required data is a file format (GPX or TCX) and a user ID (when you sign into Strava, click on your face in the upper-right. When that page loads, the number at the end of the URL in the address bar is your user ID) 

/**********************
THINGS TO KNOW
This is designed to run from the command line, and will save your files as GPX or TCX to your home (~) directory; on OS X, it's the folder that looks like a house. Keep in mind that this may take many gigabytes of space if you have a lot of rides. It might also take a long time. 

The script requires that readline() be installed with your version of PHP. If you encounter a "Call to undefined function readline()" error, please see this work-around: https://github.com/cosmocatalano/strava-export/issues/1#issuecomment-19875546

Rides will be saved as their Strava activity ID. Not descriptive, but the best solution given the constraints.

ON A MAC/LINUX
(this assumes you have PHP installed)
 -  download the ZIP from Github. Unzip it.
 -  Open Terminal, type 'php', then the path to wherever the unzipped version is
 	e.g., the full command would be 'php ~/Downloads/strava-export-exodus/exodus.php' 
 	if you saved it in your Downloads folder (on OS X). 
 -  Follow the instructions. The script will try and keep you updated.
 
ON A PC
- uh...probably Google "command line php windows"? Honestly, I don't know & don't have time.
 
I made this in a hurry. Not sure what'll happen with trainer rides, skiing/walking events, etc.
